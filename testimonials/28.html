		Susan Twining <br>(Xpat New Zealander)<br>Taggia, Italian Riviera<br>Canelli Olive Oil<br>email: <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="6a191f190b04441e1d030403040d2a1c03180d030444040f1e">[email&#160;protected]</a><br>Date. April 2012<br><br>Jacqui and Rod are quite fantastic! I waited sometime for their arrival knowing of Rod's reputation in NZ as an Award Winning Master Builder. My expectations/hopes were greatly exceeded as both he and Jacqui are both such skilled hard workers who are also great fun and a real pleasure to be with. They work well together and this enables them both to work to each other's strengths. Both are imaginative problem solvers who look for positive outcomes. <br>While at Canelli they installed a kitchen - made an IKEA kitchen into an almost 'bespoke' kitchen and cleaned, prepared and laid a reclaimed mahogany parquet floor. I had no idea of what I was asking until we began! Jacqui cleaned nearly 2000 wood tiles, Rod remedied a badly 'bowing' floor and sanded and laid the tiles. The result is wonderful. <br>In addition they did much else: Jacqui strimmed the terraces, faster than anyone else has ever done; Rod checked over the house and made a variety of repairs/improvements. Rod earned the nickname Archimedes for restoring the shed roof which had entirely blown off. A series of pulleys, tree pruning and the help of a Nissan Micra restored it to the right way round on the building! He then secured it properly. All this was done the morning before they left when they had planned to cycle along the coast. <br>I strongly recommend that any host ensures they are enabled to give their best by providing proper tools and allowing them scope to work.<br><br>We cannot believe that we have been so lucky as to have had Jacqui and Rod for three weeks. <br>I recommend them both without reservation and am happy to provide further references/photos of their work, etc. as required. We now hope they will come to our place in London. <br><br>Susan Twining<br><br><br><br>Host Name: Bell Masterman, Sydney Australia<br>Australia: December, 2010<br><br>If you are lucky enough to have the opportunity to have these guys to stay TAKE IT WITH BOTH HANDS! They are amazing. They are so experienced, hardworking and enthusiastic. You can leave them to their own devices and magic will happen. I could prattle on for a very long time about what they're good at, but it's a very, very long list. Not only are they knowledgeable they're incredibly tidy guests and great for a yarn. <br>We only hope that one day they will come back and visit again. In the meantime, we wish them a joyous journey. It's hard to imagine two people who deserve it more.<br><br>Host Name: Sandy & Roger Cutter, Amberac, France (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a8dbc9c6ccd1cbdddcdccddae8c4c1decd86cbc786ddc3">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>France: December 2011<br><br>These guys are like gold dust! Rod is the best builder ever, there is nothing he won't turn his hand to and make a top class professional job of. Rod & Jacqui  are a joy to have around, intelligent, helpful and with a great Kiwi sense of humour. They work well as a couple or individually and give back 100% I would not hesitate to engage Rod for anybuilding project! This was their second visit and we are looking forward to their third visit with open arms. Sandy and Roger.<br><br>Host Name: Donatella, Villa Fantasia, Rome (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4c232f292d22252d3636393e3e250c2b212d2520622f2321">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>Italy: October, 2011<br><br>What I love of being part of "Helpx big family" goes beyond 'work that gets done' as to me it is much more often an invaluable human experience, due to the people that I have got the chance to meet and share time with. Rod and Jacqui are one of these lucky moments, being the time spent with them pleasure, fun...and yes, a lot of work done in the merriest and most energetic atmosphere. Jacqui cleaned and prepared an old iron stove, prevailed on ivy that had been strangling trees and ruining walls for years, cut laurel bushes, prepared, loaded and unloaded endless boxes of logs happily driving my car up and down the property, while Rod, the King of Chainsaw, cut tons of wood for winter, walked on my roof fixing things - actually fixing things wherever he saw and decided was needed - repaired the small door for the cats to get into the house but most of all created the best way to make that 'pot belly stove' work - and how well!- for the winter to come, deciding what to buy, how to fix everything. Expertise and creativity are his best tool: for Rod everything "is a piece of cake". And the strength and energy of Jacqui helped me in everything was needed with the loveliest smile. In all this, good laughs, nice talks, free time spent happily together sightseeing around...,so, not only 'Helpers', but new friends, who will always be more than welcomed in my home again...hope soon!<br><br>Host Name : David Smythe and Sundara Farley  (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="f281879c96938093dc9493809e978bb285939c93969d9ddc9480">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>France September 2011 <br><br>Rod and Jacqui are unbelievably committed to helping and with the building skills of Rod you will be very lucky indeed if you can arrange a work/cultural exchange with this couple. On top of this they are great company and our days were full of laughter when they were around.<br><br>In addition we would just add that Rod is looking to do some paid work in Europe and this is part of his thirst for life and new experiences. He is, in fact, greatly in demand in New Zealand but prefers a change. <br><br>He absorbed so much detail of our sizeable property and immediately noted the many things needing to be done. We can honestly say we have never encountered anyone with his fine builder's eye.<br><br>We wish them well and feel confident they will find great opportunities wherever they go.<br><br>Host Name: Helene Rondelez, Paris France  (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="09617b66676d6c656c73497068616666276a6664">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>France  August 31, 2011<br><br>Rod and Jacky spend ten days with us on our boat in Paris, and it was an absolute joy for us to share time, talks, and parties with them. It was a wonderful experience to have such an enthusiastic and happy couple over, and we felt lucky they had chosen to stay with us. <br>My son Louis greatly appreciate them as well, as they both manage to spend some special time with him, and they build him the greatest cabana ever, made out of old pieces of wood we found in a garbage, but it is like marble to him. This was really awesome. <br>After that, Rod fixed the wall in my kitchen very nicely, hard to explain exactly how but the result is great. Last, Rod and Jacky were highly helpful in the everyday routine : cooking, cleaning, opening wine bottle, and commenting the boats passing by. <br>We are trying to make plans so they could come back to our place in the fall. <br><br>Host Name: Sandy and Roger Cutter, Amberac France (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="3447555a504d57414040514674585d42511a575b1a415f">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>France: July 2011<br><br>Rod and Jacqui have increased their stay here from two to four weeks and we are so pleased! They are just a brilliant couple to have share our home and life. They fitted easily in with us and our little dog from day one and are such a help to us, Rod in assisting Roger with his renovations and gardening and Jacqui with all her help in cooking lovely healthy meals, gardening, ironing and computers! They have enriched our lives with their humour, energy and ability learn the game of Rummikub! They will be sorely missed by both us and our friends. Hope to have them back soon! <br><br>Host Name: Joyce Scott and John Cooke, St Pierre France (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="701a1f09131503131f040430171d11191c5e131f1d">[email&#160;protected]</a>)<br>France September 2011<br><br>We had a wonderful ten days with Rod and Jacqui! They could not have been more fun, more helpful or better company. Rod did an amazing job in our granier: building the walls and ceiling for our new kitchen and bathroom, as well as putting in a sink and counter. Everything was done beautifully. He's a master craftsman!<br><br>Jacqui helped with gardening, canning and freezing our fruits, cooking delicious dishes and teaching me computer skills which I lacked, even setting up St Pierre and Bali Volunteers blogspots for us. On their last day, she was busy painting the trim in the new kitchen and bathroom.   Anyone who has their help will be lucky indeed. Our only regret was in saying goodbye, we hope to see them again one day.<br><br>Host Name: Marc Escalant, Serres France (<a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="b1dcd0c3d29fd4c2d2d0ddd0dfc5f1d6dcd0d8dd9fd2dedc">[email&#160;protected]</a> )<br>France November 2011<br><br>Rod & Jacqui were our first helpers. It was a wonderful experience due to their very easy going personality. They helped in building and painting.  Rod is very experienced man in building and Jacqui in painting. And we had the pleasure to enjoy Rod's special delicious breakfast prepared with the eggs from our chicken. They are both jack of all trade and very open to help with animals or gardening ... Very good time together and happy to see you again.<br><br><br/><br/>
